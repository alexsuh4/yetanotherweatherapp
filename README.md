What 

 A simple .Net Winforms client for showing Israel Weather

Why 

Becouse I got sick of opening a stupid bloated news site , just to get the weather , 
and to show off to my siblings

How

At the time the Israeli methorological service provided a downloadble XML file of current weather , 
All that's left is some XML parsing ,a quick GUI using .NET Winforms and some quick optimizations (do not hit server every time).
Also there is a cloud moving animation in the about page , which movement speed is relative to the wind speed of the currencly watched weather.
